It is a SQL database  project that making access to movie datas easier. 

# Prerequisites

Install MSSQL Server to build and manipulate database.

Install Flask and pyodbc to use and manage database by user.



# Database System
We design a movies and series database system for the people that loves watching. The
purpose is categorized movies and series according to their topics thus , people reach the
information about movies and series that they like easily. There are also categories to
which movies and series belong. This categories are action, adventure, animation, comedy,
crime, police, drama, biography, fantastic, horror, musical, etc. We have entities which are
Product, Series , Movies, Episodes, Watchlist,Friends, Account, Free_Account,
Premium_Account, Category ,Options, User , Actor, Director and Contact. The user with an
account can search for movies or series of his favorite genre in the database. So he/she
does not have to work too hard for the movie or series he’s/she’s looking for. He/she can
also search for movies from his favorite actors and directors. In addition, it has easy
access to movies and series with high IMDB points, movies according to the years they
want to watch and movies that need to be watched before they die. Those who are curious
about the movie before watching the movie will be able to look at the IMDB favor rate. In
addition, users with a premium account can create their own watchlist. Users who have
trouble accessing data can take information via the contact section. Maybe this is a
database that can be used by movies, series, videos or blog sites. Users can only view
movies. But those who have an account can view movies and series.

We used Flask to make the database interface.
